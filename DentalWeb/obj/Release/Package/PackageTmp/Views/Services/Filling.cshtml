            <b>Direct Fillings (directly placed in the tooth).</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Permanent fillings - e.g. Silver amalgam and Miracale Mix (dark fillings), Glass ionomer cements and Composit (white fillings) etc.</li>
                <li>Temporary fillings - e.g. Zinc oxide eugenol, Zinc phosphate, caviton/hydraulic restoration etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Indirect Fillings (fabricated in a lab and then bonded/cemented to the tooth)</b>

                <li>Inlays and Onlays - Gold, Cobalt chromium, porcelain etc.</li>

            <h4>Types of Fillings</h4>
            <p>Amalgam (silver) fillings are resistant to wear and relatively inexpensive. How ever, due to their dark color, they are not usually used in visible areas, such as front teeth. </p>
            <p>
                Composit resins are matched to be the same color as your teeth and therefore used where a natural appearance is desired. Composites may not be the ideal material for large filling as they may chip or wear. They can also be stained out over a period of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gold fillings are made to order in a laboratory and then cemented into place. Gold inlays are well tolerated by the gum tissue, and may last the longest. For these reason many authorities consider gold the best filling material. How ever it is oftern the most expensive choice and requires multiple visits.
            </p>
            <p>Porcelain fillings are inlays or onlays which are produced to order in a lab and then bonded to the tooth. They can be matched to the color of the tooth and resist staining. A porcelain restoration generally covers most of the teeth. </p>

            <h3>FAQs</h3>
            <h4>Why do we need a filling?</h4>
            <p>A filling is a way to restore a tooth damaged by decay, to enhance the aesthetic of the tooth, and to restore chipped or broken part of the tooth to their normal function and shape. </p>
            <h4>Which type of filling is best?</h4>
            <p>No one type of filling is best for every one. What's right for your tooth will be determined by the extent of the repair, whether you have allergies to certain material, where in the mouth the filling is needed, and the cost. </p>
            <h4>Is it necessary to replace Amalgam or Silver fillings?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>We advice our patients to replace amalgam filling if only when necessary, such as when fillings are worn out, broken, falls off, leaks, and cracks.</li>
                <li>It is best not to remove existing restoration that function well.</li>
                <li>The process of removing the restoration release more mercury.</li>
                <li>If one is more concerned about amalgam as a filling material choose a different material for your new restoration such as composit resin, porcelain, gold, cobalt chromium etc. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Should we visit a amalgam free practice?</h4>
            <p>It is not necessary to seek treatment at a practice that does not use mercury. How ever if you have mercury allergy or if one is pregnant, you must inform your dentist. </p>
            <h4>What are inlay and onlays?</h4>
            <p>Inlay and onlays are indirect dental restoration that reinforce an existing tooth that is too damaged to support a filling, but not damaged enough to require a crown. An inlay is cemented on the chewing surface between the bumps (cusps) of a tooth where as onlay cover one or more of the cusps. </p>
            <h4>How are inlay and onlay done?</h4>
            <p>There are two types of inlay and onlays and they are direct and the indirect types. Direct inlays and onlays are done inside dental office and are placed in only one visit. The indirect ones are fabricated in the laboratory and require two visits to complete the procedure. </p>
            <h4>What are the materials used for inlay and onlay?</h4>
            <p>Gold, cobalt chromium, composit resin or ceramics may be used to create inlay and onlays. Which material is chosen may be influenced by aesthetic appeal, strength, durability and cost. Other factor that influence the longevity of an inlay or onlay includes strength of tooth that is treated, the amount of chewing that occurs on the restoration and patient's willingness to maintain oral hygiene and to have regular dental examination.</p>
